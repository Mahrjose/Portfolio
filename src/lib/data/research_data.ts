      abstract:
        "As digital identity becomes foundational to accessing public services, ensuring national security, and safeguarding individual autonomy, conventional centralized identity systems reveal significant limitations in privacy, interoperability, and user control. These systems depend heavily on centralized authorities, placing sensitive personal information at risk of breaches, unauthorized access, and misuse. Additionally, they lack interoperability across platforms, leading to fragmented and inefficient identity verification processes. Most critically, users remain passive participants with minimal control over their own data. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized identity framework grounded in the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)...",

      description:
        "Conducted a sentiment analysis project on a dataset of social media posts (e.g., Twitter or Reddit) related to a specific topic. Utilized basic NLP techniques to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and visualize trends. This project served as an introduction to data collection, text preprocessing, and basic machine learning model application.",
